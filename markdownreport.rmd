# Identification of Thin Layers
This project intends to create an algorithm to identify thin layers based on CTD datasets. The research is conducted by the OOI cabled array team and their student participants, Connor, Marie, Jenn, and Jordan, with each participating student on the cruise linked here: (https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/visions-21-students/) 

## What are Thin Layers ?
Thin layers are "concentrated aggregations of phytoplankton and zooplankton in coastal and offshore waters that are vertically compressed to thicknesses ranging from several centimeters up to a few meters and are horizontally extensive" They are important to research because: 
1. They are a topic of future interest and future research
2. Useful in efficiently isolating thin layers from large data files
3. Can control and predict the formation of thin layers

### Criteria for Identifying Thin Layers
- Must be at most 5 m thick
- Must be a pattern of repeating profiles
- Chlorophyll concentration peak must be at least 3x more than the background data
This criteria was included in the algorithm through the R-Studio code
Here is the criteria for thin layers in code format with for loops and if statements used to use the criteria:

### Datasets used
Our group used datasets from 2019 CTD data in Rob Fatland's repository, (https://github.com/robfatland/ocean/tree/main/profiles), in order to get the dataset running in R-studio to create visualizations and the desired algorithm

## Including Plots
Here are some of the plots our code visualized while removing some of the profiles that were unneeded.
