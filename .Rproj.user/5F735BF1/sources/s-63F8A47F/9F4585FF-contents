# Graphing chlorophyll over time

# Sorting our data (METHOD 1):
# Positive slope = data we want ??? (ask Jordan about this)
# Put it in a new dataset of just what we want
# Cut different columns and rows out based on profile data

# Criteria for thin layers:

# Establish the peak (METHOD 2)
# If the peak concentration is 3X the background (background in avg concentration)
# Average all data and see where it peaks or not
# Return true or false (boolean variable)
peak_concentration_check <- function(peak_con, back_con, df) {
  if ((back_con * 3) == peak_con) {
    return(TRUE);
  } else {
    return(FALSE);
  }
}

# Less than 5m thick (METHOD 3)
# Should be pretty easy
# Should return true or false (boolean variable)

# Assuming both the above methods are true, is it a pattern (METHOD 4)
# Above methods return true for >= 2 profiles in a row (!!!!!)
# Call above methods
# Make a count variable
# Return true or false (boolean variable)

# Create a new dataframe of just true data, then call it to graph

# Next steps :
# Get Jordan on the call
# Get CSV file situation figured out
# Figure out the profile (up or down)
# Ask about negative or positive slope
# Maybe the one going down (slope situation here)
